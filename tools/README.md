# FlashOS

To generate the code, run "make clean && make all", this will generate a flashOS.s68 file.

To update the OS from DdraigDOS, run the command "srec" and send the flashOS.s68 file via the serial terminal. Once downloaded the command "run 100000" will update the Flash memory with the latest version.
